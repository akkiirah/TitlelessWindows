JNK License 1.0 – Non-Commercial, Anti-Capitalist, Remix-Friendly (2025)
by akkiirah (https://dstwre.sh)

This is a non-commercial, remix-friendly license for creative and software  projects.  
Code-wise, it vibes with the Anti-Capitalist Software License (ACSL): https://anticapitalist.software/

You’re free to use works under this license to learn, experiment, create, remix, build, and share, as long as it’s not for commercial purposes.
Take them apart, make them your own, use them in your projects, and pass them on freely, not for a price.

Works under this license are meant to be shared without restriction and at no cost.
Selling them, charging for access, or wrapping them in ads or monetized platforms is not allowed.
Voluntary support is allowed, but it must never be required to access any version, form, or part of the work.

If you’re unsure whether your use is in the spirit of this license, ask yourself honestly: 
Are you creating something, or are you extracting from something?
And if you're still unsure, or genuinely interested in a use that touches on the commercial, consider reaching out to the original creator. 
A conversation is always better than assumptions.
If you use these works in something you’re releasing, feel free to use this license too. 
There’s no obligation, but if the intention behind it speaks to you, carry it forward.
If your project allows commercial reuse (like with some other open licenses), be mindful: 
you may be opening the door to uses that go against this spirit. Choose consciously.
 
Selling these works, in original or modified form, is not allowed.
Including them in commercial products or platforms, or using them to generate profit through ads, paywalls, NFTs, AI training, or other exploitative systems, goes against what this license is about.

This license is not about control, it is about intention, and not a loophole, but a stance.
It is for those who create out of curiosity, who remix because something matters to them, and who build things for the sake of it, not to make money.
It protects a space where creativity can remain public and freely shared, instead of being turned into something private or profit-driven, and it carries forward the spirit of independent cultures that came before it, where sharing was the norm and selling was never the point.
It supports non-commercial, anti-corporate, remix-friendly use of creative works, because not every technical use is a problem, but every profit-driven appropriation is.  
The name JNK stands for *Just Use, No Kapitalism* (with a K, on purpose) and also nods to the idea that licenses are junk. In a better world, we wouldn’t need them at all. This should be the default. 
If that speaks to you, use it and let it speak through your work.
